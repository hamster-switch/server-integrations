# Hamster Switch Server Integrations

Linux-only, administrator-confirmed patch delivery for the Hamster Switch
integrations maintained for sub2api and new-api.

The updater consumes **formal GitHub Releases only**. Every release manifest is
signed with this repository's Ed25519 key and every downloaded asset is checked
with SHA-256 before it is inspected or applied. Unknown or locally drifted
upstream source trees are diagnostic-only: there is intentionally no force flag.

## Commands

```bash
hamster-integrations inspect sub2api --target /srv/sub2api
hamster-integrations check sub2api --target /srv/sub2api
hamster-integrations update sub2api --target /srv/sub2api --mode manual
hamster-integrations rollback sub2api --target /srv/sub2api
```

`check` never applies a patch. `update` prints the exact affected files and
deployment actions, then requires an interactive confirmation. `manual` changes
only the verified source files and reports the remaining build/restart steps.
`systemd` and `docker-compose` accept only the structured, signed operations in
the release manifest; arbitrary shell hooks are not supported.

## Release trust root

The embedded public key is documented in
[`docs/release-contract.md`](docs/release-contract.md). Its private counterpart
is stored only as the repository Actions secret
`HAMSTER_INTEGRATIONS_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY`.

No patch release exists until the sub2api or new-api integration task contributes
an exact upstream fingerprint and deterministic replacement bundle.
